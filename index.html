<h4>WHAT IS TEA?</h4>
<p>Coming after water, tea is the <b style="background-color:lime">second most consumed drink </b> in the world.</p> 
What comes as a surprise to many is that all teas (i.e. White, Green, Oolong, Black, and Pu-erh) come from the same plant – Camellia Sinensis.
<p>Camellia Sinensis is a sub-tropical, evergreen plant native to China. However, since the early 19th century after merchants brought it to India, the tea plant has been growing all around the world. 
Varying with the time of year when the leaves of Camellia Sinensis get harvested, as well as the processing technique used after the harvest, several forms of tea come to life. Therefore,
 "tea" is everything that derives from the Camellia Sinensis plant.</p>

<div class="border">
<blockquote> 
Anything else, while sometimes called "tea", is more accurately referred to as an herbal tea or <i> tisane </i>. Tisanes include chamomile, rooibos and fruit teas, amongst others. Another vital difference between tisanes and teas is that tisanes are always caffeine free.
